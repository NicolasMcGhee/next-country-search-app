This is a Next.js Project that uses the restcountries API and allows you to search for specific countries and regions for details.
The features are:
light/dark functionality using Next Theme, 
A fully working search bar and dropdown menu to easily search for whichever country you're interesting in,
foutes the correct data to the country's pages, so the information you want is what you get,
finally, using the tailwind CSS library, NOT only looks fanastic, also fully responsive.
